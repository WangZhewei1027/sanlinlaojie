# Team workbench and map collections

- Scope: the team content surfaces after the 2026-10-17 team-workbench decision: the workbench (`/manage`), asset detail (`/manage/assets/[id]`), map collections (`/manage/collections`, `/manage/collections/[id]` hosting the placement map), onsite capture target (`/upload-onsite`), the team settings entry, and scene publish/model-picker integration. Mode: Operate. The scene editor (`/manage/scenes/[id]`) keeps its own brief for its Unity/Timeline layout; product truth comes from `PRODUCT.md`, `docs/team-workbench.md` and `docs/team-workbench-backend-contract.md`.
- Audience and job: team members who find, upload and compose content, then place published scenes and assets on map collections; viewers who browse read-only. Main task: find or add content in one place, open it, and later put it on a map.
- Confirmed direction (user, after researching logged-in Kivicube; supersedes the earlier row-only, no-collection rule): map collections, scenes and basic assets have separate sidebar entries (user screenshot, latest instruction); scenes and assets use independent thumbnail libraries; every team member shares all content and collections. Organization is called 团队. No global workspace selector, no project grants, no project member matrix, no maintainer gating; `maintained_by` is informational.
- Extension of the incumbent console: semantic tokens, `components/ui` primitives, `<Text>` three-zone typography, Geist plus Chinese system fonts, hairline borders, 8px radius. No new palette or fonts, no hero metrics, no invented charts, no marketing composition.
- Structure: persistent left sidebar 地图合集 / 场景 / 基础素材, with secondary 团队设置. `/manage` opens `/manage/assets`; `/manage/scenes` is a separate scene library. On mobile the sidebar opens in a labeled sheet. Each library has a title, short team context and its own actions: upload for assets, create/import for scenes. Compact tools include search, lifecycle and grid/list; only assets show a type dropdown. Content-led tiles keep name, type/date and scene publication badges. Collections retain dense rows. Map and scene editors keep their dedicated full-size layouts and return to their matching library. Semantic tokens and typography stay unchanged.

- Version, maintainer and dependency mechanics recede into asset detail (versions, usage with collection names, archive). Scene copy is same-team, name only. Placing content happens only inside a collection; the source picker lists all team assets and published scenes.
- States: grid and list skeletons, team-empty that teaches upload and scene creation, type-empty with the matching action, archived-empty, filtered-empty with clear filters, error with retry, viewer and migration-frozen read-only explanations in plain Chinese (English localized), legacy-team feature notices, collection not found, archived collection with restore.
- Component boundary: `app/manage/content` stays presentational (props + `ContentAction` callbacks, no fetches or DTOs). Route components (`app/manage/workbench`, `app/manage/collections/components`, `app/manage/assets/components`) own team context, API calls, mapping and capabilities. Stories in `stories/content` cover workbench, card, row, toolbar, collection list/dialogs/header with mock data, including viewer, empty, loading, error and mobile.
- Product boundary: first release has only map collections. No activity, topic or tree UI.
